There's some good bits about teaching on Zoom <!--more-->, particularly related to the time I need to wake up and how comfortable my clothes are. 

Reflection is a good habit to be in, so it's worth thinking about the process of making material for zoom, and how the classes run. 

Reflective prompts for for zoom presentations:
1. _How necessary is this video?_ Is it worth watching at 2 Frames Per Second? Does it really need the audio? Do the participants need to see the whole video?
2. _What if something goes wrong?_ For ever 5 participants, 4 will tell me how to use zoom if there is the slightest malfunction. Can I just make the presentation more simple? Can I just not share the video audio? Or not have the video? Or a slideshow. Or a zoom meeting?
3. _Am I wasting anyone's time?_ Yes, but is my content worth wasting the time? 
4. _How long have we all been on zoom already?_ When was the last time I took more than 300 steps a day? What day is it? Why am I here?

Reflecting on being a teacher in a Zoom class:
1. Students can turn their camera on if they want. I have no place being in a students' home, I'm lucky that I can curate what they see of my home. 
2. Not all internet connections are created equal. Also, some of the class is asleep. Both of these things are out of my control.
3. Powerpoint has a Reading View. Google Slides has a Presenter View. Consider why this is better than full-screen presentations, and by how much?
