The breeze on the side of Iris's face was getting too strong. She stood up from her chair and walked over to the window<!--more--> and swiped her finger down the biofilm beside the window. It felt smooth, cool. The flow of air stopped abruptly as the window closed. Nothing had moved, but tiny holes in the transparent biofilm had closed.

Iris rolled her eyes a moment later as the cold air from the a/c hit the skin on her other side.

"O-home, why did you do turn on the a/c?" she asked the AI assistant that lived in the walls of her apartment. The was a brief, but too-long pause before the reply as a server somewhere computed an answer. The Open-Home project AI was never as quick as the commercial software when it had to process a response. 

"The internal temperature is above 24Â° so I turned on cool air--do you wish to change the thermostat setting?"

"No." Another pause

"OK. If you wish to change automation settings, you can use any Open-home panel."

Iris took off a slipper and threw it like a paper aeroplane towards the doorway into her home office. It hit the invisible biofilm panel beside the door, the solid tap notifying the AI assistant that it was time for it to stop talking. It was too late though, once you break your flow (or your assistant decides your flow is broken) your home notifications are turned back on. She could update that setting later. One of the advantages of installing an open-source home assistant. 

"You have three new emails, none of which are marked important." O-home said, "and I have added bread to your shopping list."

Thinking that was odd, and since her mental flow was long gone now, she went to the kitchen. She was sure she had just bought bread, and she definitely needed coffee. 

She opened her cupboard and saw the bread had blotches on the inside of the bioplastic bag. Red indicates *Penicillium*, not safe to eat any more. She picked up the bag and looked through the sections that were still clear. The bread looked fine, she couldn't see it growing. But the red colour on the packaging indicated that the spores had made it onto the bag in an amount that meant they were also through the food already. She sighed and placed the bread on the garbage chute. An invisible camera (probably in the ceiling), made from a dense lensing hydrogel over a patch of photosensitive biofilm, scanned the package, identified it, and the garbage cover opened towards the appropriate chute.

Iris started her coffee machine on its little ritual. She looked up and the panel next to the kitchen window was bright green, like some kind of pond slime. This system needed to be taken care of--it needed food too, and the biofilm engineers used green, she guessed, to remind people that the *bio* in this biosystem means that it's alive. She reached under the kitchen sink and took out a small spray bottle, with a generic brand nutrient-rich broth and sprayed it onto the green patch. The liquid was absorbed before it had a chance to run down the wall. As the green colour faded a message was left behind:

"Castle Homes<sup>TM</sup> recommends NutriTech<sup>TM</sup> supplement for your integrated biohome system"

Anthropogenic biology at its finest, bacteria in the biofilm advertising at you. In your own home. The microscopic assholes. The text faded back to nothing, and the wall again looked like there was nothing there, no technology, no computer. It was only if you looked at just the right angle could you see a reflection from the low-sheen surface of the biofilm.

Iris grabbed her coffee and walked back down the corridor to her office, she could hear a call coming into her computer from the corridor. She didn't hurry, since it was someone from work and she was supposed to be off today. She had routed work-related meetings to the office.
