{% newthought 'Physical activity in VR is good for you,' %} even if it's not trying to be.<!--more--> That's what we found in a paper we published last year at ACM CHI conference{% sidenote 'sn-id-chireference' 'Yoo, S., Gough, P., & Kay, J. (2020). Embedding a VR Game Studio in a Sedentary Workplace. *Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, 1â€“14. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376371](https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376371)'%}.

Importantly, for 6 participants, only with the VR game studio did they meet recommended activity levels. Our key contributions are insights about the use of a workplace VR game studio and its health benefits.' %}


## How this paper came about
This paper was part of [Dr Soojeong Yoo's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soojeong-yoo-81b59784) research into the benefits of physical activity from VR, and representations of physical activity gained from VR {% sidenote sn-id-davi 'see also: Yoo, S., Gough, P., & Kay, J. (2018). VRFit: An Interactive Dashboard for Visualising of Virtual Reality Exercise and Daily Step Data. [doi.org/10.1145/3292147.3292193](https://doi.org/10.1145/3292147.3292193)' %}. We were both working in USYD's School of IT\* {% marginnote mn-id-SIT '\*now school of computer science.' %} with Prof. Judy Kay. I worked on some data analysis, and Soojeong led the study. It took more than one attempt to get into CHI, as it's quite a competitive conference, and our paper improved (the system works!?) with reviewer feedback.


## Why it's worth looking at this problem
Lots of jobs are pretty sedentary nowadays, more than half o the jobs in Australia are performed while seated. Some solutions have included things like walking desks, pedals under your desk: solutions that keep people at work, but being a little bit physical. Adults need either 30 minutes of moderate activity, (or 15 minutes of vigorous activity) on most days to get enough exercise{% sidenote sn-id-exerciseplz 'William Haskell, et al. 2007. [Physical activity and public health](https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=sph_physical_activity_public_health_facpub)' %}. For this study, Soojeong focused on taking a break from work, but it applies pretty broadly. 

## What did we do?
Soojeong's study was the first to look at how people chose to use a VR studio in an otherwise sedentary workplace. There were two main questions throughout the study:
{% quotation 'What health benefits do participants gain from VR game studio sessions?' %}
{% quotation 'What motivates participants to use the VR game studio and how to they use it?' %}
So Soojeong set up a VR studio in one of the school's research spaces. Participants could book a time to go there (one at a time please) during work hours, take a break from what they're doing, play some casual VR games, and then get back to the desk. The idea is the participants could take a break and do something different, which is pretty normal. So why not play a game?

## What we found out
{% newthought 'VR Games give you real exercise' %}. Participants wore a pebble watch to record their steps wile the study was running. This meant we could see if they were getting exercise anyway. While playing the VR games, they wore a heart rate monitor, that measured levels of activity, since the pebble can't detect activity when you're playing a game, which is the [same for when pushing a stroller or shopping trolley](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Inspire-Inspire-HR/Not-counting-steps-when-pushing-stroller-or-grocery-cart/td-p/4253926){:target="_blank"}.

{% marginfigure "margin-figure-stepsdays" "assets/img/posts/exercise-in-vr/dots1.png" "Most people still didn't get enough days with 30 minutes of exercise, but VR helped." %}
We found that when people had the option to go to the VR studio and play a game, they got more exercise. It's not a silver bullet, but one extra thing you could do.

{% newthought 'Competition was a good motivator choose a game to play, but not to play in the first place' %}. From about halfway through the study the participants were able to earn a place on the coveted leaderboard: whiteboard consisting of imaginary internet points. The participants were also asked why they wanted to the games they chose, and also why thy decided to play games that day. 

Just under half of all responses to why they came to the VR game studio were related to how they felt about work: they were tired, stressed, or wanted a break. Once they got there, the leaderboard helped them choose which game they would play.  People also felt more relaxed after playing the game, of course, they've been playing a game. 

## What next?
People need to take breaks from working, even in sedentary jobs. Some people go for a walk, get a coffee, others might just sit and watch YouTube on their phone. So, if sedentary workers play a game in VR wile they take a break, does that provide a benefit to them? It seems so. 

Our participants got a little bit of exercise playing the game. It did depend on the game, [*Holopoint*](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2202354219893697/?locale=en_US){:target="_blank"} gave players a high % of playtime as vigorous physical activity, whereas [*Longbow*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450390/The_Lab/){:target="_blank"} was less efficient, mostly moderate activity *but* participants also played it for longer. Managers, take from that what you will. 

Additionally, players weren't taking the break to play games because of the games themselves. They really needed the break.
