{% newthought 'I decided to start a blog. ' %} I've been convinced by [Liz Gilleran](http://lizgilleran.com){:target="_blank"} that it's a worthwhile use of my time.<!--more-->  If you are interested in design, you should give her blog a read! Liz gave an inspiring talk at the [Visualisation Matters](http://visualisation.matters.today/2021/){:target="_blank"} symposium, which I enjoyed. 

## About me
I suppose might introduce myself. I earned my PhD from USYD in the Design Lab, now referred to as the discipline of Design at ADP. I'm now lecturing there, via a few roles in other unis, organisations and faculties. You can check out the discipline's research at [https://design.sydney.edu.au](design.sydney.edu.au){:target="_blank"}.

I'm now working in Design at USYD, research and teaching. My area (and probably my next blog post) is Biodesign. 

I haven't had a "standard" start to my academic career at USYD. After my thesis I did a postdoc with the [Human Centred Technology](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/human-centred-technology.html){:target="_blank"} group in School of Computer Science. Following this I worked in Faculty of Science in an educational innovation role. My thesis and my work in Science was focused on interdisciplinary art-design-science collaboration, and I was invited to join Design Lab to run the new [Major in Biological Design](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/subject-areas/major/biological-design.html){:target="_blank"}*{% marginnote 'sn-id-biodesign' '*Pronounced _biodesign_, surely'%}.

I've had the chance to work on projects in Data Visualsiation and Biodesign, but all focus on *interactions* - the way we build and evaluate interactive things, mostly digital systems. The way a person sees a visualisation and wants to understand it, the way someone feels about a mushroom-based object in their home, the way an expert uses a decision support tool, the way someone might feel immersed in a VR experience. The interactions with different systems is where my research interest lies. 

So, here I am. I have a blog now. My goal is to share some thoughts on design, research, life or whatever else this becomes.
